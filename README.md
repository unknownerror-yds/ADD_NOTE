<h1>ADD NOTE
 
<h2>Introduction

<h3>While Listening / Reading something, taking notes is an important procedure.

<h3>So here is a android app for doing same in which u can perform all CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

<h3>I have used Room persistence library for the database part of the application, which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
